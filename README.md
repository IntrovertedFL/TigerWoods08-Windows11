# Bug Fix
There are files responsible for a memory leak. The file keeps getting bigger and bigger and eventually crashes the game. Unfortunately youâ€™re going to have to do this with the pro golfers you want to use too!

After you have created your character. Play 1 hole on any course and exit the game. Next go to your documents directory and find Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 directory. Go to \Career\Players\<your character name>\Confidence. Keep this window open because we're coming back to it. Delete all files in this directory. Run the game again. Play one hole and exit. Go back to the confidence directory, which should still be open and highlight all files with Ctrl+A. With second mouse button click on properties and set the file Attributes to Read Only.

And we're done! Enjoy the game!
